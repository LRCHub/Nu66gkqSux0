You're standing there so lonely
Wish that I could help you out
You used to be so lovely
But I know you are too proud
I know inside you're empty
And spring won't come again
You just don't see reality
To you it's just a pain
＜♪＞
Try to wake up to a morning
Try to find a new beginning
Try to find what you've
been missing
On the past just stop depending
Try to wake up to a morning
Try to find a new beginning
Try to open up your eyes
Stop telling yourself lies
Why keep on hanging to the past
Can't we make a fresh new start
Beauty won't last forever
Unless it grows in your heart
＜E-Piano Solo＞
Try to wake up to a morning
Try to find a new beginning
Try to find what you've
been missing
On the past just stop depending
Try to wake up to a morning
Try to find a new beginning
Try to open up your eyes
Stop telling yourself lies
Why keep on hanging to the past
Can't we make a fresh new start
Beauty won't last forever
Unless it grows in your heart
